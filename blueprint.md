# Project Overview

A powerful and intuitive scientific calculator designed for machine learning engineers and data scientists. This web-based application will provide a comprehensive set of scientific and statistical functions, along with matrix and vector operations, to assist with complex calculations and data analysis tasks.

# Application Features

*   **Modern & Responsive Design:** A visually appealing and mobile-friendly interface built with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
*   **Web Components:** The calculator will be built as a reusable Web Component for encapsulation and maintainability.
*   **Basic & Scientific Calculations:**
    *   Standard arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
    *   Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan)
    *   Logarithmic functions (log, ln)
    *   Exponential functions (e^x, 10^x, y^x)
    *   Factorial, square root, cube root
*   **Statistical Functions:**
    *   Mean, median, mode
    *   Standard deviation, variance
*   **Linear Algebra:**
    *   Vector and matrix display.
    *   Basic matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
*   **Interactive UI:**
    *   A clear display for input and results.
    *   A history of calculations.
    *   An intuitive button layout.

# Current Plan

1.  **Create `blueprint.md`:** Document the project's purpose, features, and development plan.
2.  **Structure the application:**
    *   Set up the main HTML file (`index.html`) to include the calculator component.
    *   Create a CSS file (`style.css`) for styling.
    *   Create a JavaScript file (`main.js`) for the application logic.
3.  **Build the Calculator Component:**
    *   Define a `<scientific-calculator>` custom element.
    *   Use Shadow DOM to encapsulate the component's structure and styles.
    *   Use an HTML `<template>` for the calculator's UI.
4.  **Implement Functionality:**
    *   Handle number and operator inputs.
    *   Implement basic arithmetic.
    *   Add scientific and statistical functions.
    *   Implement matrix and vector operations.
5.  **Style the Application:**
    *   Apply a modern and visually appealing theme.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and accessible.
6.  **Test and Refine:**
    *   Thoroughly test all calculator functions.
    *   Check for and fix any errors.
    *   Refine the user experience based on feedback.
